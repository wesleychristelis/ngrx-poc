// // NOTES:
// // Why we dont store as an array?
// // 1. what if the array is large the time complexity could be large
// // 2. what about insertionn of courses , into various locations in the array
// // 3. updating an item ?
// // other arrays introduced will add a lot of boiler plate code , repeatedly. The same reducer logic needs to be applied to other collections
// // The best way to store our collections would be in the form of a map and a corresponding collection of Id's

// // We could do this , but the boiler plate code would be too much
// export interface CoursesState {

//     coursesEntities:{[key:number]: Course}; // we will use a map, however we lose the order in which the entities are sorted
//     courseOrder: number[] // we keep the Id of a given course here
// }

// export interface LessonsState {

//     lessons: {[key:number]: Lesson};
// }
